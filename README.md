## Project Title
# **Condominium Data Preprocessing and Management Tool**
-----------------------

## Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive Python-based solution for preprocessing and managing data related to condominiums across France. Originating from official government data, it has been significantly enriched through meticulous web scraping of Pages Jaunes. The resulting dataset offers an extensive overview of property management companies (syndics), condominiums, and their operational hours, organized within a structured SQL database. This preparatory work lays the foundation for the development of a specialized application aimed at enabling commercial teams to effectively optimize their engagement strategies with property management entities.

## Key Features:

- **Data Enrichment:** Leverages advanced web scraping techniques to enhance government-sourced condominium data with additional insights from Pages Jaunes.
SQL Database Integration: Efficiently structures enriched data into an SQL database, comprising multiple tables for syndics, condominiums, and their business hours.
- **Preprocessing Capabilities:** Offers robust tools for cleaning, organizing, and preparing data for downstream applications, ensuring high data quality and usability.
- **Future Application Foundation:** Sets the stage for the creation of a targeted application designed to improve commercial outreach to property management companies.

## Motivation:

The inception of this project was driven by the need to consolidate and enhance publicly available data on condominiums in France, to address the challenges faced by commercial teams in navigating the complex landscape of property management. By automating the data preprocessing steps and creating a reliable data foundation, we aim to streamline the process of engaging with syndics, ultimately facilitating more effective and efficient commercial strategies.
